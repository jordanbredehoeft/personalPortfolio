Personal Portfolio
=================

Personal Portfolio website for Senior Capstone Class.

<h4>Details:</h4>
For the personal project for our CIS 440 class, I created a simple resume/portfolio site to showcase my skills
and past work. This site can be a tremendous resource for me in the future. I can include the link to my site on my 
resume, giving recruiters a place to go to retrieve an electronic copy of my resume. Additionally, I have included a function 
on the page allowing browsers to download a .pdf copy of my resume. Other than including an electronic form of my resume, I have 
included a section welcoming visitors, giving them a brief overview of my skills, a section displaying my past work, giving visitors
screenshots and brief descriptions of my work, a blog post section, giving readers a look into other things I am interested in 
other than software development, and finally a contact section to allow visitors the ability to send me an email regarding future
opportunities or comments they have on my site.

To begin with, I used a one-page bootstrap CSS template that I found online to make my portfolio site look very professional. For our group 
capstone project, a majority of my responsibilities were styling pages. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the CSS portion of
web development, and wanted to focus on other areas. I then edited the html content of the page to display my personal information, and had to do minimal
changes in the CSS to get columns to align and to make all the text visible. 

The part where I really wanted to showcase my skills was in adding Javascript elements and adding a Wordpress blog to my page. My tech talk was on Wordpress
so I felt this was a great opportunity to be able to apply what I learned. I added some cool javascript functions to my page, such as making elements appear 
as the visitor scrolls down the page, adding filters to my past projects, as well as multiple image sliders.

<h4>Skills Showcased:</h4>
This personal project furthers my learning in a variety of ways. For our capstone project, my main duties were to edit the styling of our pages. While I enjoy
doing this, I wanted to get a better grasp of all front-end aspects, so I decided to focus on  my Javascript skills incorporating cool new features. Additionally
I wanted to show off the skills I have developed studying Wordpress, so I have an included a Wordpress blog that this portfolio site will pull from.

<h4>To DO:</h4>
I have not had a chance to complete all the elements of my personal site, but it still includes a majority of the functionality. I still have to incporporate 
my wordpress blog, and setup queries to run in my Latest Blog Posts section. Additionally, I still have to photoshop some background images to throw in a slider at the
very top of the page.
